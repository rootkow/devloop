"""Guard tests for the agent-base Dockerfile.

The entrypoint runs as ``python /usr/local/bin/agent-entrypoint.py`` and does a
bare ``import skills``, which only resolves when ``skills.py`` is baked into the
same directory (sys.path[0]). This regressed once: the COPY was dropped while the
``import skills`` line stayed, so every released Agent Job crashed at import with
"No module named 'skills'". These tests fail loudly if the two ever drift apart
again — they only parse text, so they run anywhere without Docker.
