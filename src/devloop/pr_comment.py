"""PRCommentWorkflow — respond to reviewer feedback on open agent PRs (#78).

Triggered by ``webhook.py`` when a human posts a ``pull_request_review`` or an
``@devloop-bot``-mentioning ``issue_comment`` on an open ``agent/issue-<N>``
PR. The workflow re-engages the agent on the existing branch:

    "⏳ queued" ─▶ Phase.PR_COMMENT job (PR number + comment/review body;
                   the agent fetches the diff itself via ``gh pr diff``)
                 ─▶ CI Fix Cycle (delegate to standalone ``CICycle``)
                 ─▶ request reviewer + post result comment

A concurrent run for the same PR (workflow ID
``pr-comment-{owner}-{repo}-{pr_number}``, ``TERMINATE_EXISTING`` conflict
policy) terminates the in-flight run and starts fresh — the newest comment
wins as context.

# in that payload); ``_handle_issue_comment`` can't — an ``issue_comment``
# payload carries no head ref, only a PR number — so it dispatches with an
# empty ``branch`` and lets ``get_pr_branch`` resolve it here. Re-checking the
# resolved branch closes that gap: without it, an ``@devloop-bot`` mention on
# *any* open PR (not just agent-owned ones) would resolve a real branch and
# proceed to the entrypoint's ``force=True`` push — clobbering a human's work
