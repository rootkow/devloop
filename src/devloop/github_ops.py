"""GitHub REST activities for the Dev Loop (issues #22, #23, #81).

Network access is via ``httpx`` against the GitHub REST API.

Two authentication modes are supported for devloop-bot:

* **GitHub App** (recommended, issue #81) — when ``GITHUB_APP_ID`` and
  ``GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`` are set, devloop mints short-lived (1h)
  installation access tokens: a JWT is signed with the app's RSA private key
  and exchanged via ``POST /app/installations/{id}/access_tokens``. The
  resulting token is cached process-wide and refreshed 5 minutes before it
  expires. ``GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID`` selects which installation to use.
* **Fine-grained PAT** (existing, fallback) — each enrolled project carries
  its own scoped GitHub token (``github_token_secret`` in the registry); the
  token is resolved per project from that Secret at call time, so different
  orgs/owners use different credentials.

When GitHub App auth is configured it takes priority for *all* projects (the
app is installed per-repo on GitHub's side); otherwise devloop falls back to
the project's PAT. This keeps existing PAT-based deployments working
unchanged.

    on a PR) reference the PR only by number, unlike ``pull_request_review``
    payloads which include ``pull_request.head.ref`` directly (issue #101).

    Returns ``""`` on an unresolvable PR (404, rate limit, GitHub 5xx,
    connection error) rather than raising — log-and-degrade (issue #87) so
    the workflow can fail cleanly with an explanatory comment instead of
    sinking the whole run on a transient GitHub-side hiccup. The caller
    treats an empty result as "could not resolve" and refuses to dispatch
    rather than risk an empty-branch clone or a wrong-ref push.

    Used by ``Phase.CI_FIX`` (CICycle) to decide whether to keep retrying and
    to hand the fix Agent Execution Job the precise set of failing checks via
    ``TaskSpec.extra["ci_check_failures"]``.

    A check run "passes" when its ``status`` is ``completed`` and its

    folded into ``failures`` — so ``CICycle`` can tell "still running, wait
