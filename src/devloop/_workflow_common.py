"""Shared workflow helpers (issue #78).

``DevLoopWorkflow`` and ``PRCommentWorkflow`` both need to post GitHub Issue/PR
comments, dispatch Agent Execution Jobs, run the Phase.CI_FIX retry loop, and
request a GitHub PR reviewer. Rather than duplicate that logic, it lives here
as a mixin (``_WorkflowCommon``) both workflow classes inherit from — methods
are plain ``async def`` calls into ``workflow.execute_activity`` so they stay
sandbox-safe and behave identically regardless of which workflow calls them.
