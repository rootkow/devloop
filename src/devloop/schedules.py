"""Temporal Schedules for the Dev Loop nightly sweep and weekly summary.

* Nightly (03:00): start a Dev Loop per enrolled project. The Plan phase no-ops
  cleanly when a project has no open agent-ready issues (issue #20).
* Weekly (Mon 08:00): start a Summarization workflow per project (issue #24).

    """Create the schedule, or update an existing one to match ``schedule``.

    ``ensure_schedules`` runs on every worker startup, so updating in place is
    how config changes propagate to the nightly sweep — e.g. a changed gate
    timeout in the workflow input (DevLoopInput.from_env) or a changed cron spec.
    Without this, the first create would win forever and later config edits would
    silently never reach the schedule.

    Code owns the action, spec, and policy; the operator owns runtime state, so
    whether the schedule is paused, its note, and any remaining-action limit are
    read from the live schedule and carried across the update unchanged (a worker
    restart must not silently un-pause a schedule an operator paused).

    Reconciliation is best-effort: it runs on the critical worker-startup path,
    so any failure (e.g. the ``describe_schedule`` RPC behind ``update`` timing
    out on a slow Temporal cluster) is caught and logged rather than allowed to
    crash the worker. The describe is read-only, so a failed update leaves the
    live schedule untouched; convergence simply retries on the next startup. The
    trade-off: while reconciliation keeps failing, code-side config changes
    (e.g. a new gate timeout) won't reach an already-existing schedule — hence
    the loud WARNING so a persistent failure stays visible.
