"""Summarization workflow (issue #24, #79).

Runs on a weekly Temporal Schedule. Reads the changes since the last
summarized commit, asks the LLM for a plain-English digest, and publishes
it as a GitHub Issue on the enrolled repo with a ``devloop-summary`` label.
An optional outbound webhook URL receives the same payload (fire-and-forget).

Sandbox-safe: only stdlib + shared imports here. The I/O (GitHub compare, LLM
call, dedup state, GitHub Issue creation) lives in ``summarize_activities``
and is referenced by name.
