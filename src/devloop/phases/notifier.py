"""Notifier — request a reviewer and post a notification comment.

Wraps the existing ``_notify_reviewer`` activity call from
``DevLoopWorkflow`` as a standalone deep module with a small
interface: ``run(inp, issue, exec_result, callbacks)``.

Reads ``pr_reviewer`` from the project's ``ProjectConfig`` (via the
``request_github_reviewer`` activity). The notification only claims a
reviewer was tagged when the request actually succeeded — when it was
skipped (no reviewer configured, no PR to request on) or failed (a
GitHub API error), the comment says so honestly instead (issue #88);
a confidently-wrong "tagged" claim would mislead the human who's
supposed to act on it.
