"""PlanPhase — plan the next round of issues.

Wraps the existing ``_plan_phase`` activity call from ``DevLoopWorkflow``
as a standalone deep module with a small interface: ``run(inp, rnd, callbacks)``.

Two paths:
* **Webhook-triggered** (``triggering_issue > 0``): lightweight ``plan_issue``
  activity — one GitHub API call to confirm the issue is open and still
  labelled, then a string-format for the branch slug (issue #120).
* **Backlog** (``triggering_issue == 0``): full Plan Agent Execution Job
  dispatch for backlog reasoning.

After plan resolution, ``_drop_issues_in_review`` filters out issues that
already have an open agent PR so the workflow doesn't re-surface them.
