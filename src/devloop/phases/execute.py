"""ExecutePhase — dispatch the agent execute job.

Wraps the existing ``_execute_phase`` activity call from ``DevLoopWorkflow``
as a standalone deep module with a small interface: ``run(inp, issue, callbacks)``.

Handles dispatch retries for zero commits, mid-run question resolution,
and delegates to ``CICycle`` for the CI fix loop.
