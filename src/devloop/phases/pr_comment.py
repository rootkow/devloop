"""PRCommentPhase — respond to reviewer feedback on open agent PRs (#78).

Wraps the branch resolution, validation, and agent dispatch from
``PRCommentWorkflow`` as a standalone deep module with a small
interface: ``run(inp, callbacks)``.

After the phase, the caller (typically ``PRCommentWorkflow``) runs the
CI fix cycle and requests a reviewer — those are separate phases.

The ``_AGENT_BRANCH`` regex guards against clobbering human branches
(issue #101).
