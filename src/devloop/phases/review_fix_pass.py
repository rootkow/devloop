"""ReviewFixPass — one fix pass after a review's findings.

Wraps the existing ``_review_fix_pass`` activity call from ``DevLoopWorkflow``
as a standalone deep module with a small interface: ``run(inp, issue, exec_result, review, callbacks)``.

The reviewer's summary (which enumerates unmet acceptance criteria and
bugs) is handed to the fix agent exactly like a human PR comment would
be — the proven re-engagement path (omneval#70: the agent resolved
every finding of a human review in one such pass).

Returns True when the fix pass produced commits (a re-review is
worthwhile), False when it failed or changed nothing.
