"""Dev Loop Temporal workflow (issues #20-#23, #74) — fully autonomous model.

Once an issue is labelled ``agent-ready`` the workflow runs autonomously
through to reviewer notification with no human-approval gates.

    ┌──────────────────────────── round ─────────────────────────────┐
    Plan ─▶ Execute ─▶ Review ─▶ Request Reviewer + Notify
    └───────────────────────────── repeat ───────────────────────────┘

One issue at a time: the homelab DGX model serves a single request at a time,
so parallel agent Jobs would just block on inference. Each phase is a K8s
Agent Job driven by a bundled prompt (plan/implement/review).

Architecture note (issue #149 / #153): the orchestration loop has been
extracted to ``devloop.phases.PhasePipeline`` and the per-phase logic
lives in standalone deep modules (``PlanPhase``, ``ExecutePhase``,
``ReviewPhase``, ``ReviewFixPass``, ``Notifier``).  This workflow is a
thin adapter — it inherits from ``PhaseOps``, delegates all its methods to
Temporal activity calls, and passes itself as the unified callback seam to
every phase.
